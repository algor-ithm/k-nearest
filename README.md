# Banknote Authentication Using kNN Model

A k-nearest neighbors (kNN) model implemented to classify banknotes as authentic or counterfiet based on features extracted from the images of banknotes.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) model to classify banknotes. The dataset used is the Banknote Authentication dataset. The kNN algorithm is implemented from scratch and also using the `sklearn` library for comparison. The project invloves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
